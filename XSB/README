Prototypical Prolog-Implementation of the access analysis presented in the paper
  "Model-Driven Specification and Analysis of Confidentiality in Component-Based Systems"
submitted to the 1st IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2016.

Requirements:
   XSB Logic Programming and Deductive Database system for Unix and Windows,
   available from http://xsb.sourceforge.net/
   Our implementation was tested with version the XSB release 3.5.


Running:  On a Linux system with XSB installed, run
  "make"
to create a text file "queries-justify.result"
containing all vulnerabilities in the sample architectural and confidentiality model
defined in the *.P files from directory "Instances/PaperExample/ExampleOne/"

If a suitable ghc distribution is available, you can run
  "make queries-justify.result.pretty"
to create a text file "queries-justify.result.pretty" with more readable formatting
